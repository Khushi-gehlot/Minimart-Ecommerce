# Minimart-Ecommerce

Minimart is a fullstack Data Engineering project with a layer of data analytics.  It simulates a real-world e-commerce environment to demonstrate the end-to-end process of data collection, transformation, storage, and visualization. The primary focus of the project is to design and implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines that handle data generated from an online retail system.
